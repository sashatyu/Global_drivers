This is a project providing the code and example of input data to reproduce the numbers presented in the following publiation: Tyukavina et al. (in review) Global extent and drivers of tree cover loss quantified with high resolution satellite data.

Area estimation is performed using equations from Stehman (2014) paper: [https://doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2014.930207](https://doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2014.930207)

Example of input data presented in this repository includes per-block proportion of total tree cover loss from Tyukavina et al. (in review) study to compute global area of tree cover loss, as well as the geographic region each sample block belongs to, to demonstrate computation of regional statistics.

To derive per-block proportions of tree cover loss and compute area estimates for individual loss drivers, pre-disturbance tree cover types, climate domain and countries, please refer to the full dataset presented at: [https://glad.umd.edu/Global_drivers/](https://glad.umd.edu/Global_drivers/) and archived on Zenodo: (add doi later)
